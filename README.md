# X-CUBE-ISP

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/badge/tag-1.2.0-blue)

The X-CUBE-ISP package provides the functionnality to control and tune the
DCMIPP ISP present in the STM32N6x products.<br>
It contains:<br>
- An embedded ISP Library middleware (running on the target) hosting 2A
  algorithms (Auto Exposure and Auto White Blance) and mechanisms to control
  the ISP and load sensor tuning file.<br>
`x-cube-isp/Middlewares/ST/STM32_ISP_Library`
-  A tuning application (running on the target) that allows to interact
  with the STM32 ISP IQTune desktop application executed on the host computer
  and connected through usb.<br>
`x-cube-isp/Projects/DCMIPP_ISP/ISP_IQTune_App`

To take control of the DCMIPP ISP:<br>
- The host computer must execute the STM32 ISP IQTune desktop application and
connect to the target thanks to an USB-C cable on the USB1 (CN18) connector of
the board.
- The ISP IQTune App must be loaded and launched on the target.

## Features demonstrated

- Control of all ISP parameters via desktop application
- Image analysis function for camera sensor tuning
- Generation of sensor ISP tuning file
- Embedded Auto Exposure algorithm (AE)
- Embedded Auto White Balance algorithm (AWB)
- STM32 ISP IQTune application

## Hardware Support

- MB1939 STM32N6570-DK board
  - The board should be connected to the onboard ST-LINK debug adapter CN6 with
  a __USB-C to USB-C cable to ensure sufficient power__
  - An additionnal USB-C cable to connect USB1 (CN18) to the host computer for
  the STM32 ISP IQTune desktop application connection

- 2 camera modules are supported:
  - MB1854B IMX335 (Default camera provided with the MB1939 STM32N6570-DK board)
  - STEVAL-66GYMAI VD66GY camera module

Note:<br>
- The support of customer sensors is possible since customer respect the driver
and integration format of the Camera Middleware.

## Tools version

This package is compatible with the following tool version:
- STM32CubeIDE (**v1.17.0**)
- STM32CubeProgrammer (**v2.18.0**)

## Boot modes

The STM32N6 does not have any internal flash. To retain your firmware after
reboot, you must program it in the external flash. Alternatively, you can load
your firmware directly from SRAM (dev mode).<br>
In dev mode, if you turn off the board, your program will be lost.

__Boot modes:__
- Dev mode: load firmware from debug session in RAM (BOOT1 switch to the right,
BOOT0 switch position doesn't matter)
- Boot from flash: Program firmware in external flash (BOOT0 and BOOT1 switch
to the left)

## Quickstart using prebuilt binaries

The `X-CUBE-ISP/Projects/DCMIPP_ISP/Binary` directory hosts the ISP IQTune
prebuilt application which is the tuning application (running on the target)
that allows to interact with the STM32 ISP IQTune application executed on the
host computer and connected through usb.

Applications is available for MB1939 STM32N6570-DK board.

  1. Toggle BOOT1 switch to right position
  2. Program `X-CUBE-ISP/Projects/DCMIPP_ISP/Bin/STM32N6_ISP_IQTune_App-v1.0.0-trusted.bin` as described in [Program bin files using command line](#program-bin-files-using-command-line)
  3. Toggle BOOT0 and BOOT1 switch to left position
  4. Reset board


## Quickstart using source code

Make sure the boot switchs are in dev mode (BOOT1 is on the right side).

### STM32CubeIDE

Double click on `X-CUBE-ISP/Projects/DCMIPP_ISP/ISP_IQTune_App/STM32N6570-DK/STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run with build and run buttons.

### Change the camera module

The software is natively compatible with the MB1854B IMX335 and STEVAL-66GYMAI
VD66GY camera modules. Simply change the camera module and restart the software.
No software reconfiguration is needed.

Note:<br>
 - For customer camera module, the sensor driver must be added in the Camera
 Middleware and a first tuning must be performed with the STM32 ISP IQTune
 desktop application to generate the final isp_param_conf.h that can be
 updated.

### Create binary for boot from flash

Make sure the STM32CubeProgrammer bin folder is added to your path.

```bash
STM32_SigningTool_CLI -bin STM32CubeIDE/release/STM32N6_ISP_IQTune_App.bin -nk -t fsbl -hv 2.3 -o STM32N6_ISP_IQTune_App-trusted.bin
```

### Program bin files using command line

Make sure the STM32CubeProgrammer bin folder is added to your path.

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG ap=1 -el $DKEL -hardRst -w X-CUBE-ISP/Projects/DCMIPP_ISP/Bin/STM32N6_ISP_IQTune_App-trusted.bin 0x70000000
```
